# FAQ

## Is this a meme? Why is the name `nyaa` chosen?
This is not a meme.
I spent too much on this project to be just a "meme".
The name was chosen because it is a original name (suprisingly nobody made a package manager named `nyaa`). 
Also it is a short name that is extremely fast to type (which is important for a package manager since you will use it a ton). 
The name also implies how much of a weeb i am.
